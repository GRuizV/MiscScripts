0:00 - It's such a weird stereotype
0:02 - to have associated with your ethnicity.
0:04 - Right? That stereotype of Asian parents wanting their kids to be doctors.
0:09 - Right? It's such a weird thing to have  on your race.
0:12 - Like, what is that? Is that good? Is that bad?
0:14 - I thought it was a good thing.  Apparently, it's worthy of mockery.
0:17 - Right?
0:19 - Asian parents wanting their kids to be doctors.
0:20 - It's weird because it's true.
0:22 - Right? I know because my parents were the same way.
0:24 - They just wanted us to be doctors.  It was like this obsession.
0:27 - They just wanted us to be doctors.
0:28 - And it's insidious as well,
0:31 - because when Asian parents want their kids to be doctors,
0:35 - helping people is, like, on the bottom of the list of reasons.
0:38 - [audience laughs applauds]
0:44 - Oh, if it even makes the list... of reasons to go into medicine.
0:50 - Helping people is, like,  the unfortunate by-product...
0:52 - [audience laughs]
0:55 - of becoming a healthcare professional.
0:58 - Like, when they first see that they can't even believe it.
1:00 - They're like, "What the fuck?  You gotta help people?
1:03 - Well, whatever, get it out of the way.
1:06 - But don't let it get in the way of what this is really about.
1:10 - It's about the money  and the prestige, right?"
1:13 - It's the money and the prestige.
1:15 - Because if you're  a first-generation immigrant,
1:18 - your children becoming doctors is the quickest way
1:21 - you can turn it around in one generation.
1:24 - Instant credibility,  instant respectability, instant money.
1:27 - Right? You flip the clan narrative around. Boom!
1:30 - Started from the bottom, now we here.  We're doctors! [laughs]
1:33 - [audience laughs]
1:35 - And it's also weird because Asian parents are also the last group of people
1:39 - you can ever convince to see a doctor.
1:41 - [audience laughs, cheers, and applauds]
1:46 - Yo, these fucking people will never see a doctor.
1:50 - They spend their whole lives obsessing over it.
1:52 - Nothing can make my mom see a doctor. There's nothing...
1:55 - My mom can have an arrow  going right through her. [pants]
1:58 - And she's trying to pull it out like Rambo, right?
2:00 - And you're like, "Yo, Mom, let's go see a doctor."
2:03 - And my mom will be like, "No.
2:05 - They just want to take people's money."
2:07 - [audience laughs and applauds]
2:12 - Then you're like, "Then why do you want your kids to be doctors so badly?"
2:16 - [strained] "Because I want my kids to take other people's money, obviously!"
2:21 - [pants] "The fact that you don't understand that
2:23 - is the reason  why you never became a doctor."
2:26 - -[groans] -[audience laughs]
2:31 - Because Chinese people love money.
2:35 - We love that shit.
2:37 - Chinese people fucking love money.
2:40 - Okay? You think rappers love money?
2:42 - Yo, we love money...
2:43 - [audience laughs]
2:45 - ...more than anyone.
2:46 - Chinese people love everything about it.  We love making it, love spending it,
2:49 - we love giving it, we love receiving it, we love throwing it up in the air.
2:52 - Yo, Chinese people love money so much,
2:56 - we have a god of money.
2:58 - [audience laughs]
3:00 - Of all the gods in Chinese Taoism,  there's one god, he's the god of money.
3:04 - Caishenye, we pray to him...
3:07 - for more money!
3:10 - Every day, we go, "Hey, god of money..."
3:13 - [audience laughs]
3:16 - "...give us more money."
3:18 - And he gives us more money.
3:21 - Very fickle god.  Doesn't care about inflation, right?
3:24 - No understanding of basic principles  of macroeconomics, just...
3:27 - Just throwing out gold ingots  if you ask for it at the right time.
3:31 - "Here's some money. Burn some incense.  Here's some money, man."
3:36 - Even during Chinese New Year,
3:38 - the biggest holiday for Chinese people,  Chinese New Year,
3:41 - when we see each other during Chinese New Year,
3:44 - the way we greet each other is we say, "gong xi fa cai,"
3:48 - or "gong hei fat choy" in Cantonese.
3:50 - I'm sure you've heard that,  at least peripherally, "Gong xi fa cai."
3:55 - Gong xi fa cai means, "Hope you get rich!"
3:57 - [audience laughs]
4:01 - [audience cheers and applauds]
4:05 - That's not "Happy New Year."
4:07 - [audience laughs]
4:12 - Do you understand, the go-to phrase  during Chinese New Year
4:16 - isn't, "Hey, happy New Year."
4:18 - It's, "Yo, hope you get rich."
4:20 - [audience laughs]
4:21 - "Hope you get rich. Hope you get richer than all these other motherfuckers.
4:24 - Hope you get so fucking rich, man.
4:26 - Hope you get rich and also hope... You better hope I get rich.
4:28 - We can hope each other... Both get rich together."
4:32 - [audience laughs]
